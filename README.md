Navigation: Previous/Next buttons + direct page selection

Smart Page Display Logic
typescript
if (totalPages <= 5) {
  show pages 1-5
} else if (currentPage <= 3) {
  show pages 1-5
} else if (currentPage >= totalPages - 2) {
  show last 5 pages
} else {
  show currentPage - 2 to currentPage + 2
}
Pagination Reset
Automatically resets to page 1 when:

Items per page changed

Date filter applied

Date filter cleared

🎯 Performance Optimizations
Frontend Optimizations
useCallback: Memoized fetch functions

Client-side Filtering: No API calls for date filters

Pagination: Limited data rendering (10-50 items)

Lazy Loading: Modal content only when opened

Debouncing: (Could be added for search inputs)

Backend Optimizations
Lean Queries: .lean() for faster MongoDB queries

Selective Population: Only populate needed fields

Indexing: (Should be added on createdAt, userId fields)

Limit Queries: .limit(50) for all-campaigns

Sorting in Database: .sort() on indexed fields

Database Optimizations
References: ObjectId references vs embedded documents

Array of IDs: User's allCampaign array for quick lookup

Timestamps: Automatic createdAt/updatedAt

Lean Documents: No unnecessary Mongoose hydration

🐛 Error Handling Strategy
Frontend Error Handling
Network Errors
typescript
try {
  const response = await fetch(...)
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error(...)
} catch (err) {
  setError('Network error. Please try again.')
  console.error(err)
}
Display Errors
Error state in component

Red notification banner

Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds

Manual dismiss with X button

Download Errors
Separate downloadError state

Specific error messages

Button remains functional after error

No page reload required

Backend Error Handling
Standard Error Response
typescript
{
  success: false,
  message: 'Descriptive error message'
}
HTTP Status Codes
401: Unauthorized (no token)

403: Forbidden (wrong role)

404: Not found (campaign/user)

500: Internal server error

Error Logging
typescript
console.error('Error in {controllerName}:', error)
🧪 Testing Considerations
API Testing
Tool: Postman

Endpoints: All routes tested with various scenarios

Authentication: JWT token in cookies

File Uploads: Multipart form data testing

Frontend Testing (Recommended)
Component rendering tests

User interaction tests (button clicks, form submissions)

API integration tests (mocked responses)

Responsive design tests

Backend Testing (Recommended)
Unit tests for controllers

Integration tests for API routes

Database operation tests

Authentication/authorization tests
